                                north-west, and South India for Nilgiri. 
                                The estates of Darjeeling cling to the foot 
                                hills of the Himalayas, and the tea is 
                                grown at the land up to 2,000 meters height. 
                                Assam is world largest tea-production region.

                                climate conditions. Shade trees are intentionally 
                                planted near the Assam trees to protect them from strong 
                                winds and direct sun. Nilgiri farms are located on the 
                                hillside (1200 to 1800 elevation) of the South edge of India. 
                                Bangladesh Tea fields are located close to the home land of Assam. 
                                Estates are also located on the flat area.
